# CINA Official Website - Product Manual

## 1. Product Positioning & Goals

The CINA Official Website (`cina-official-website`) is the primary information portal and marketing platform for the CINA ecosystem. It does not provide any on-chain interaction features, and its core goals are:

*   **Branding & Communication:** Clearly convey the vision, value proposition, and core products of the CINA Protocol to the public.
*   **User Education:** Detail the various components of the protocol, such as the WRMB stablecoin, sWRMB interest-bearing token, and CINA governance token, lowering the cognitive barrier for new users.
*   **Trust & Credibility:** Build a professional image among users, investors, and institutions by showcasing partners, news coverage, and clear documentation.
*   **Traffic Gateway:** Serve as the central landing page for all marketing campaigns and guide users who wish to perform on-chain operations to the correct, independent DApps (e.g., "CINA Console" or DEX trading platform).

## 2. Target Audience

*   **Potential General Users:** DeFi users who want to understand and use the WRMB stablecoin.
*   **Partners:** Other projects or platforms looking to integrate with the CINA Protocol.
*   **Investors & Researchers:** Individuals or institutions looking to evaluate the investment value and technical potential of the CINA Protocol.
*   **Media & Community:** Media practitioners and community members seeking official information and press releases.
